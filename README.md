# Ransomware-Riddles
Module 10 Challenge UWA Cybersecurity Bootcamp 2024.

Ransomware Riddles
note
The main part of this Challenge assignment reinforces the cryptography topics that we covered in class this week. However, the assignment also includes a Career Services reminder at the end—make sure to complete your milestones to become employer ready and employer competitive.

In this assignment, you will play the role of a cybersecurity analyst at Nakatomi Hospital.

Unfortunately, one of the hospital's doctors opened an email containing ransomware.

This ransomware spread throughout the hospital and encrypted all patient records.

The ransomware has given you two options to decrypt and retrieve the patient records: either pay 100 Bitcoins or solve six riddles.

Since you refuse to pay a ransom, you'll have to solve six cryptographic riddles. Act fast: the doctors need to access the patient records as lives are at stake!

Instructions
In order to solve the riddles, apply the cryptographic concepts that we've covered in the past three lessons.

Once you've solved a riddle, submit your answer on the bottom of the Riddle page.

If you have solved the riddle correctly, you will receive a key. Keep notes of all the riddle answers and keys. You will use those keys to answer the questions in this quiz.

Once you have collected all six keys, select the Ransomware Decrypted header on the website and enter all your keys.

If all six keys are correct, the ransomware will be removed and the data will be decrypted.

Good luck, and act fast—the Nakatomi patients are counting on you!
